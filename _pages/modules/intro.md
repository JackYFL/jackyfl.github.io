Hi, I'm Yifan Li (李一帆), a Ph.D. student (2023-) at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) of Michigan State University (MSU), supervised by Prof. [Yu Kong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wXA8nb4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Before that, I obtained my Master's degree (2020-2023) at the Institue of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS) supervised by Prof. [Hu Han](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4v709-MAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao), and I also collaborate closely with Prof. [Shiguang Shan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vkzd7MIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). I obtained my Bachelor's degree (2016-2020) at Northeastern University supervised by Prof. [Long Cheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Tmu1QacAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

My research interest includes computer vision (CV) and deep learning (DL). More specifically, my goal is to exploit the knowledge from imperfect data (unlabeled or mislabeled data) and improve the model's generalization and robustness. My current research interest is Embodied AI so that humans can work with machines collaboratively. 

I am so excited to witness and participate in the revolution of artificial intelligence. I am also open for collaboration to create better jobs, so if you are interested please reach out and do something cool.
